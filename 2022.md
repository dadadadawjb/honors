      * $\mu$ is consistent with original reweighted loss, as score-based model estimating score function $s_n(x_n) = \nabla_{x_n} \log q_n(x_n)$
      * $\sigma$ can be also estimated by using the score-based model by Monte Carlo sampling $\Gamma_n = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{\|s_n(x_{n, m})\|}{d}, x_{n, m} \sim q_n(x_n)$, instead of original hand-craft
      * also derive theoretic bound for $\sigma$, which can be used to clip the estimated value

    * least-cost-path problem (solved by denamic programming) formulation for optimal trajectory instead of full $1, \ldots, N$

    ![DiffStride_result2](assets/2022/DiffStride_result2.png)
  * method details: 
    * replace strided convolutions by no-stride convolutions followed by DiffStride
    * Spectral Pooling formulates pooling as $\tilde{x} = F^{-1}(crop(F(x)))$ but with fixed cropping box size hyperparameter
    * make differentiable by using mask parameterized by strides

    * can also derive regularization loss to improve compute efficiency, since the bigger strides then the smaller next layer
